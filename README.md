# Data Structures
The repo contains a set of basic operations to perform on some arrays in `data-structures.js`. Look at the tests in `data-structures.test.js` to see the expected input and output for each function.

Your objective is to get each test passing by writing the code in each of these functions.

Remember to look up the native Array methods that javascript offers!

There's a bonus question at the end to filter out strings from an array in an object.

## Getting Started
- `npm i`
- `npm run test -- --watch`
